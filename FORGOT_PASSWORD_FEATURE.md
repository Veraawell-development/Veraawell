# Forgot Password Feature Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a complete forgot password and reset password functionality to the VeroCare application.

## Features Added

### Backend Changes
1. **User Model Updates** (`server/models/user.js`):
   - Added `resetToken` field to store reset tokens
   - Added `resetTokenExpiry` field to set token expiration (1 hour)

2. **New API Endpoints** (`server/index.js`):
   - `POST /api/auth/forgot-password`: Initiates password reset process
   - `POST /api/auth/reset-password`: Resets password using token

3. **Dependencies Added**:
   - `nodemailer`: For sending emails (currently logging URLs for development)
   - `crypto`: For generating secure reset tokens

### Frontend Changes
1. **New Pages**:
   - `ForgotPasswordPage.tsx`: Form to request password reset
   - `ResetPasswordPage.tsx`: Form to set new password

2. **Updated Components**:
   - `AuthPage.tsx`: Updated "Forgot password?" link to navigate to forgot password page
   - `App.tsx`: Added new routes for forgot password and reset password pages

## How It Works

### Password Reset Flow
1. User clicks "Forgot password?" on login page
2. User enters email address on forgot password page
3. Backend generates a secure reset token and saves it to user record
4. Reset URL is generated (currently logged for development)
5. User clicks reset link in email (or uses logged URL for testing)
6. User enters new password on reset password page
7. Backend validates token and updates password
8. User is redirected to login page

### Security Features
- Reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- Tokens are cryptographically secure (32 bytes random)
- Email existence is not revealed (same message for existing/non-existing emails)
- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Token is cleared after successful password reset

## Development vs Production

### Current Implementation (Development)
- Reset URLs are logged to console for testing
- No actual email sending (would need email service configuration)

### Production Implementation
To make this production-ready, you would need to:

1. **Configure Email Service**:
   ```javascript
   // In server/index.js, replace console.log with actual email sending
   const transporter = nodemailer.createTransporter({
     service: 'gmail', // or other email service
     auth: {
       user: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
       pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS
     }
   });
   
   await transporter.sendMail({
     from: process.env.EMAIL_USER,
     to: user.email,
     subject: 'Password Reset Request',
     html: `<p>Click <a href="${frontendResetUrl}">here</a> to reset your password.</p>`
   });
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   EMAIL_USER=your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
   ```

3. **Remove Development URLs**:
   - Remove `resetUrl` from API response
   - Remove console.log statements

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the server: `cd server && npm run dev`
2. Start the client: `cd client && npm run dev`
3. Go to login page and click "Forgot password?"
4. Enter an email address
5. Check server console for reset URL
6. Click the reset URL
7. Enter new password
8. Verify you can login with new password

### Test Cases
- [ ] Request reset for existing email
- [ ] Request reset for non-existing email (should show same message)
- [ ] Use valid reset token
- [ ] Use expired reset token
- [ ] Use invalid reset token
- [ ] Reset password with matching confirmation
- [ ] Reset password with non-matching confirmation
- [ ] Reset password with short password (< 6 characters)

## Files Modified
- `server/models/user.js`
- `server/index.js`
- `server/package.json`
- `client/src/pages/AuthPage.tsx`
- `client/src/App.tsx`
- `client/src/pages/ForgotPasswordPage.tsx` (new)
- `client/src/pages/ResetPasswordPage.tsx` (new)

## Future Enhancements
1. Add email verification for new accounts
2. Add rate limiting for forgot password requests
3. Add password strength requirements
4. Add audit logging for password changes
5. Add multi-factor authentication
