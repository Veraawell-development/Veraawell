# 🚀 Production Email Setup Guide

## Current Status
✅ **Email functionality is working** - But only for verified emails
⚠️ **Resend limitation** - Can only send to verified email addresses

## 🔧 Quick Fix for Testing

### Option 1: Use Verified Email
- Use `development.veraawell@gmail.com` for testing
- This email will receive the reset links

### Option 2: Verify Your Domain (Recommended for Production)

1. **Go to Resend Dashboard**: https://resend.com/domains
2. **Add Domain**: Click "Add Domain"
3. **Enter your domain**: e.g., `veraawell.com`
4. **Follow DNS setup**: Add the required DNS records
5. **Wait for verification**: Usually takes a few minutes

## 🎯 Production Setup Steps

### Step 1: Verify Domain
```bash
# Example DNS records to add:
# TXT record: resend._domainkey.veraawell.com
# CNAME record: resend.veraawell.com
```

### Step 2: Update Email Configuration
Once domain is verified, update the server code:

```javascript
// In server/index.js, change from:
from: 'onboarding@resend.dev'

// To:
from: 'noreply@veraawell.com' // Your verified domain
```

### Step 3: Test Production Emails
- Restart server
- Test forgot password with any email
- Should work for all email addresses

## 🧪 Current Testing Workflow

1. **For testing**: Use `development.veraawell@gmail.com`
2. **Reset links**: Will be sent to verified email
3. **Copy link**: From verified email to test reset functionality

## ✅ What's Working Now

- ✅ **Email sending**: Works for verified emails
- ✅ **Reset tokens**: Generated and stored correctly
- ✅ **Database checks**: Only sends to registered users
- ✅ **Error handling**: Proper error messages
- ✅ **Frontend integration**: Complete forgot password flow

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **For immediate testing**: Use `development.veraawell@gmail.com`
2. **For production**: Verify your domain at resend.com/domains
3. **Test the reset flow**: Use the reset links from verified email

The email functionality is working! Just need to use the verified email for testing or verify your domain for production use.
